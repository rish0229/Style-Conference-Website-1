            <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
            <p>
              Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or
              a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
              corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
              motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what
              stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for
              designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
              embraces design and allows it to succeed
            </p>
            <p>
              In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of
              organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will
              share what those teams, departments, and companies have that
              others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your
              own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of
              design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

            <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
            <p>
              Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or
              a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
              corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
              motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what
              stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for
              designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
              embraces design and allows it to succeed
            </p>
            <p>
              In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of
              organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will
              share what those teams, departments, and companies have that
              others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your
              own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of
              design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
